    /run/media/nishanthshanmugham/Backup,
    and the sidebar should list the Backup partition)

  % sudo fdisk -l
    (e.g., /dev/sda1)

    (prints e.g., Unlocked /dev/sda1 as /dev/dm-4.)

  # Mount it.
  % udisksctl mount -b /dev/dm-4
    (prints e.g., Mounted /dev/dm-4 at /run/media/nishanthshanmugham/Backup)
